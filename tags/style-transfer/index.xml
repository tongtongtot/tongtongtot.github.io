      <description>SCPERB: SINGLE-CELL PERTURBATION VIA STYLE TRANSFER-BASED VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER Traditional methods for obtaining cellular responses after perturbation are usually labor-intensive and costly, especially when working with rare cells or under severe experimental conditions. Therefore, accurate prediction of cellular responses to perturbations is of great importance in computational biology. To address this problem, some methodologies have been previously developed, including graph-based approaches, vector arithmetic, and neural networks. However, these methods either mix the perturbation-related variances with the cell-type-specific patterns or implicitly distinguish them within black-box models.</description>
